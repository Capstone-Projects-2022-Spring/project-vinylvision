# VinylVision
## **System Overview**
VinylVision is a web application that enables users to discover unknown music in multiple ways. 
Namely, a user can find music they do not recognize by supplying an image of an album’s artwork or a brief audio recording of a song. With the help of novel 
image and audio recognition technologies, the service will obtain information about the song or album the user is looking for, such as song title, album title, 
artist name, etc. Using these recovered details, VinylVision will search for the song or album in either Spotify or Apple Music, depending on the preference of the 
user. If the search is successful, the application will provide the user with a mini player allowing them to listen to snippets of songs from the album they were 
looking for. To listen to the songs in full, the user can choose to be redirected to their preferred music player application. Additionally, the service will 
recommend albums similar to the one the user was searching for, offering another opportunity for users to come across new music.

Users will be able to input an image or audio recording in two ways. Moreover, if a user allows VinylVision to access their device’s camera and microphone, 
the user could capture an image or record audio to submit to the service. A user could also upload an image or audio file already stored on their device.
